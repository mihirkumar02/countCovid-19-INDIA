## Data Source

The data shown in this website is fetched from this open-source [API](https://api.covid19india.org/data.json), found at this [website](https://api.covid19india.org/) . 
 
The API extracts data from various sources, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare [website](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).
The About section displays data taken from the WHO Official website.

## Why did I make it?

The sole purpose of making this website was to help the people of India in realizing the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, and how bad it can get if not taken seriously. 

## The features
 - Tabular view of state-wise data with the following columns:
   - Active denotes the currently ACTIVE cases.
   - Discharged/Migrated denotes the DISCHARGED/MIGRATED counts.
   - Deaths denotes the sadly DECEASED counts.
   - Total denotes the TOTAL of the above three columns' data.
  
 - Map-wise display of data in each state of India.
 
 - Search option for state-wise data.
 
 - Graphical view of the cases in India as a whole.
 
 - About section, which answers common questions related to the Covid-19 disease.
 
 - The list will grow soon!
 

## How to run the website on your local machine?

Clone the repo on your machine by typing

`git clone https://github.com/mihirkumar02/countCovid-19-INDIA/customFolderName`

Next, open the folder in a code editor (I recommend VS Code) and open the same in the CLI, then type:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The browser should start automatically at localhost:3000.

Great! Now you can explore the project and dive into the React components and the API.

HAVE FUN!
